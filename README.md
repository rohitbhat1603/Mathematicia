### Project Description:- ###
“Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations and algorithms; it is about understanding”

This understanding is what our team INVICTUS provides through MATHEMATICIA.

Youth are the nation's future, and the 10th and 12th grades are among the most crucial years of a student's life since these grades present a major challenge i.e. Boards.
To help students along their journey to a successful preparation with the right intake of knowledge is what Mathematicia is developed to achieve. 

We provide students with all required study resources on a single platform, taking into account the time restrictions that these boards impose.
Also due to this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, students are not able to go to libraries or access offline study materials, therefore this is a little initiative from our team to help students virtually.
